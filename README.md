### Description

This is a standalone Open Groups node. It runs in an embedded Tomcat instance.
The webapp project can be found [here](https://github.com/acionescu/og-node).

This node can run on its own and can also connect to other nodes in a federalized network that allows the exchange of different services.

For now, a simple chat demo is implemented. Each server node can join the network and the clients connected to different nodes can talk to each other seamlessly.
